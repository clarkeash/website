I am a web developer from Bristol UK, I am currently studying Web Programming BSc(Hons) at Staffordshire University.

## Technical Skills

### Languages

#### PHP

I have worked with PHP for many years. I have been using the [Laravel](http://laravel.com) framework since version 4.0. I am comfortable using Laravel and its micro-framework counterpart [Lumen](http://lumen.laravel.com). I have also worked worked with a lot of the [Symfony](http://symfony.com) components, primarily creating command line apps. I am looking forward to the new features to come in PHP 7, and I am intregued by Facebooks [Hack Language](http://hacklang.org).

#### Javascript (Front end)
I am confident with working with Javascript, I particularly like working with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) and have built sizeable apps with it. I am also very happy to use jQuery and vanilla JavaScript. I am also very interested in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) which gives a very different way of structuring apps, it even allows you to work with [ECMA Script 6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) which is neat.

#### Javascript (NodeJS)
I have worked with NodeJS on small apps, using the [express](http://expressjs.com) framework.

#### Swift
Apples new [Swift Language](https://developer.apple.com/swift) brings a breath of fresh air over the old way of developing with Objective-C which I used in the past. Using swift is a much more enjoyable programming experience.
Facebooks [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native) is on my todo list to look into, which brings its simple structure to iOS which is pretty cool.

#### Go
Googles [Go Language](http://golang.org) is all the buzz at the moment, its a relatively simple language and it was designed to be that way. I have been playing with it of late and its speed and simplicity is incredible.

### Tools

#### Version Control
I have experience working with both Git (which I use for personal projects) and SVN (which I use at Work and University)

#### Vagrant
I use vagrant to create a virtual machine locally to mimic my production environment as close as possible.

#### Docker
I really like the idea of Docker for building light-weight deployable containers, and I have used docker to ensure my staging environment is near to production as possible.

### Databases
I have worked with SQL based databases such as MySQL, SQLite and Oracle SQL. I have also worked extensively with MongoDB.
